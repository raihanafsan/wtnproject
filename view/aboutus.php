    <p id="description"><span>The journey</span><span>of PropertyExpert.com began 28 years ago with a vision to redefine the real estate landscape in Bangladesh. Founded in 1996 by our honorable Chairman, Mr. Shafiul Islam, NRE swiftly emerged as the flagship company of the Navana Group. Currently, it is a beacon of innovation and excellence for the Real Estate industry.

Acknowledged as an eminent “Super Brand” in real estate, NRE excels in unconventional building design, crafting iconic structures that inspire. Moreover, with an unwavering commitment to high standards, NRE is consistently transforming the aspirations of its customers into tangible realities.

In 2024, NRE has re-imagined its brand with a new logo, mission, and vision to reaffirm its commitment to bringing innovation. The new identity reflects the company’s dedication to staying at the forefront of the real estate sector by embracing cutting-edge technologies and eco-friendly designs.

The latest tagline, “BROADEN LIFE BOUNDARIES”, encapsulates a commitment to improving lifestyles and pushing the limits of living. This boldly refreshed brand identity articulates a forward-looking approach, ensuring that NRE continues to shape the future of real estate.</span> </p>
